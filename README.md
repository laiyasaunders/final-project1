# final-project1
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
For my final project, I want to make a website that focuses on mental health. It will explain mental health and the different types of it, how people can treat it, how it affects people, and how you can work on your own mental health. It will also include examples of treatments and self-care that you can do to help mental health. It will also include engaging videos that explain mental health and how to help it. Finally, it will include links to other websites that will help you find ideas that will help. In order to draw people in and encourage them to feel comfortable discussing their mental health, the website will be vibrant and welcoming.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
This project will be completed alone.
## Do you have any question for your own?
There are no questions at the moment!
