# final-project1
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to use Unity or Unreal for my final project to create a game that is similar to Temple Run. The graphics in this game will reflect the setting and your character. The player will use the computer to submit their actions, and they must get as many points as they can while avoiding mistakes along the way. In the game, reaching a particular number of points will advance you to a new level.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
This project will be completed alone.
## Do you have any questions of your own?
There are no questions at the moment!
